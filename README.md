# Diabetes_detection
**Project Type**: Self-Project   

---

#### Objective  
-  Built a Supervised Machine Learning Pipeline to predict diabetes diagnosis from structured clinical data.  

---

#### Approach  
• Performed Data cleaning, handled missing values, and categorical encoding using Scikit-learn pipelines.
• Trained and compared ensemble models including Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost Classifier.
• Evaluated model performance using accuracy, loss metrics, and validation curves to assess generalization.
---

#### Result
- • Achieved 68.37% test accuracy using XGBoost, outperforming Random Forest on validation and test sets.
• Maintained low train–validation gap (Train:70.77%, Val:68.32%), indicating good generalization in XGBoost.
• Random Forest showed minimal overfitting, with nearly 65.7% identical train, validation, and test accuracy.
